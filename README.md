## Changelog

**v1.4.0 major update**

In short, this version is strongly recommended for all users to upgrade, to prevent resource files from being unable to cross-platform due to previous path problems, and to have a better user experience in other aspects.

- Fix the problem that Windows path replacement does not take effect
  For example, the converted path: C:\Users\terwer\Documents\mydocs\SiyuanWorkspace\public\data/assets/import/cover.jpeg
  Now, on the Windows platform, it can be displayed normally as: /assets/import/cover.jpeg

- A new hash is added to the path to prevent the image from being overwritten when multiple files have the same image, for example: /assets/import/1nMELS/cover.jpeg

- The directory link generated by pandoc is not clickable, temporarily removed

- The pandoc footnote cannot be jumped, temporarily remove it to keep the title clean

- Fix the abnormal display problem of the top svg in some scenes

**v1.3.0 major update**

- Support image import

**v1.2.0 major update**

- Support text import
- Remove some redundant blank lines
